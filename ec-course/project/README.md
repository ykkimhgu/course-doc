# I. Introduction

##  Overview

Design problem for an application of 32-bit MCUs ( STM32F411).  You can freely choose the design problem related to smart factory, smart home system or any other related to our mechanical and control engineering.



*You need explain the overview of the design problem with a diagram and brief abstract*

[Please refer to past design problem](https://github.com/ykkimhgu/course-doc/blob/master/ec-course/project/LAB_DesignProblem_Smart%20Home_2021%20(1).pdf)

#  II. Problem 



## Problem Description

*Detail description of the problem goes here.*

Your problem must have at least 3 modes(states). Explain necessary states(modes) and description

 

Example diagram:

Description of system modes, how your MCU should function and more



*For example:* 

**1.**   **System Mode:** 

| **MODE**                     | **Description**                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Normal Mode  (NORM_MODE)     | Pressing   MODE_button (B1 of MCU_1) toggles from   NORM_mode ðŸ¡¨ðŸ¡ªSECUR _mode |
| Security Mode  (SECUR_MODE): | Pressing   STOP_button (B1 of MCU_2) resets from SIREN_mode to SECUR_mode. |

**2.**   **Front Door:**

| **MODE**                     | **Description**                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Normal Mode  (NORM_MODE)     | When a person is detected within the given  distance from the door(outside): Keep  turning on the door light as long as the person is present.   When a person is detected inside the house  nearby the door: Turn on the door light for given period of time and does not  generates the SIREN _TRG trigger. |
| Security Mode  (SECUR_MODE): | When a person is detected within the given  distance from the door(outside): Keep  turning on the door light as long as the person is present and sends the  VISITOR_LOG message to the server.    When  a person is detected inside the house nearby the door: Keep turning on the door light and  generates the SIREN _TRG trigger. |



  **3. Sensor Unit: MCU_1**

 

| **Function**                  | **Sensor**                  | **Configuration**                                            | **Comments**                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Door  Person detect  (front)  | Ultrasonic  distance sensor | Sampling 0.1 sec  Check object presence within 30cm   Generates PERSON_OUTSIDE flag | Need to check for outlier measurements  (at least 7/10 Postive)  VISITOR_LOG under SECUR_MODE |
| Door  Person detect  (inside) | PIR  motion sensor          | Edge trigger  Generates PERSON_INSIDE flag                   |                                                              |

 



 

## MCU Configuration 

You are free to select appropriate configurations for the design problem. Create a configuration table to list all the necessary setup.

| Bluetooth       | USART1       | TXD: PA9  RXD: PA10 | No Parity, 8-bit Data, 1-bit Stop  bit  9600 baud-rate |
| Timer Interrupt | TIMER1       | ...                 | ...                                                    |
