#### Weight pruning

* Set individual weights in the weight matrix to zero. This corresponds to deleting connections as in the figure above.

**Unit/Neuron pruning**

* Set entire columns to zero in the weight matrix to zero, in effect deleting the corresponding output neuron

* Read: Inception paper   __[_“Going deeper with convolutions”_](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.4842.pdf)
* 1×1 convolutions are an essential part of the Inception module.
* A 1×1 convolution returns an output image with the same dimensions as the input image.
* Colored images have three dimensions, or channels. 1×1 convolutions compress these channels at little cost, leaving a two-dimensional image to perform expensive 3×3 and 5×5 convolutions on.
* Convolutional layers learn many filters to identify attributes of images. 1×1 convolutions can be placed as ‘bottlenecks’ to help compress a high number of filters into just the amount of information that is necessary for a classification.
