## Tutorial: Version Control and Documentation

### Objective

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Github for version control of my library and how to use MarkDown to creating a documentation for our numerical method functions.

## Documentation

In this course, you have created some numerical functions to solve mathematical problems. You should make a documentation that explains about your numerical library with some usage examples.

The documentation should contain

* Function descriptions: syntax, description of parameters
* Example codes

### Exercise

Create the document for your numerical library. See example documentations for useful tips

Some helpful sites

* [Opencv Docs](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.11/d4/d86/group__imgproc__filter.html#ga27c049795ce870216ddfb366086b5a04)
* [Keras docs](https://keras.io/api/models/model/)

### Version Control

For each assignment, you probably have created ‘myNM.h, myNM.cpp’ files in every project folders.

If there are multiple source files of the same file name, you may have a trouble in controlling the version of your library.

> Create and modify myNM.h, myNM.cpp in ‘\include’ folder only

One suggestion is to create and modify your header in a directory and include those files/directory for each projects, without copying the header files in the project folder.

After modifying your library source in every assignment, you may have a problem in updating to the latest version.



For the version control, you should use git or github
